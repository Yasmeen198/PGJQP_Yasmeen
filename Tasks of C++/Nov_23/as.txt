Access specifiers are 3 keywords:
1.Public
2.Private
3.Protected
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public:
Public class members are accessible out side the class and it is available for every one.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private:
Private class members are accessible with the class and it is not accessible out side the class. 
If we try to access out side the it gives compile time error.
By default class variables and member functions are private.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected:
It is similar to private access specifier. It makes class member inaccessible outside the class. But they can be accessed by any subclass of that class.
