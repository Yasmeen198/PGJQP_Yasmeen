When static keyword is used, variable or data members or functions can not be modified again. It is allocated for the lifetime of program.
Static variables are initialized only once.Compiler persist the variable till the end of the program.
Static variable can be defined inside or outside the function. They are local to the block.The different objects of a class same copy of static variable.
In a class,we just declare a static variable and later initialize it.
The default value of static variable is zero. 

Static functions can be called directly by using class name.Static Functions can access only static variables or other static member functions.
Static functions doesnt depend on objects of class.They are invoked using .(dot)operator.

static returntype variable_name;                                                                                                        static returntype function_name();
